# Interactive_Dictionary
It is a user friendly interactive dictionary. The dictionary is somewhat smart, in the sense that if you misspell the word it will try to guess what you intended to type and offer you a few options. If you continue to misspell the word a few times in the row the dictionary will time out and the program will close. 

I had created this dictionary as part of a course mini-project.
